          <span class="first-letter">I</span> started my coding journey after becoming disillusioned with reality of the expense of being alive. Initially, I took the jump to learn how to code out of mere curiousity. I stumbled upon a youtube channel that was in my recommended videos section, and became quickly fascinated. After &ltHelloWorld&gt , I realized the amount of power that coding holds. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I began my coding journey like many do in an time of endless information... overwhelmed. It is incredible how many free and free(mium) resources exist in the world of "Coding Newbies". In that regard, it is also overwhelming for the student. Where do you start? 
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few days of countless google queries such as "What is the best free resource for learning to code in 2022", "Learning to code, help me", I finally decided that I needed to land on a resource I enjoyed and stick with it.

        <p>
            Codecademy is where I finally landed. I enjoyed how easy the platform was to navigate and there were many lessons that were free and engaging. For a week or so I took a few courses such as "Learn what to Learn" and "Code Foundations". I quickly realized that I wanted to cast a wide net and learn basics of both front-end and back-end development. I commited to the pro version of Codecademy in early June of 2022, and started the course "Full Stack Engineer Career Path".

        <span class="quote">“Failure is only the opportunity to begin again.”</span>
        <p>
          For the first two weeks, I learned about the basics of programming, barely scratching the surface. The "Code Foundations" course started with learning what the pieces of code are. Some examples of what I learned are: 
          <ul class="list">
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)" target="_blank">Variables</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type" target="_blank">Data Types</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Functions" target="_blank">Functions</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Styling_lists" target="_blank">Lists</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/loop" target="_blank">Loops</a></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Quickly, I was humbled. I consider myself someone with slightly... just slightly, above average intelligence. However, I have a knack for learning new things - I guess I'm naturally curious about the way the world works. But, learning to code is a beast in which when I began I only saw its head. Now I see its hundred-foot-long body slither towards me, and the only weapon I have is a stick.

            <span class="first-letter">Day 21.</span> After cruising through HTML and CSS basics, I began learning how to develop websites locally. I began by downloading, Visual Studio Code and familiarized myself with writing code in a text editor. I worked through a clone project, and for the first time, was sent into the deep-end by Codecademy. "Figure it out." This first experience in deep water was a struggle, and I accepted it graciously. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The course took me through web hosting. How is works, and the services offered. I learned about cloud services such as AWS, Digital Ocean, Azure and Heroku to name a few. After attempting to wrap my head around how cloud hosting works, I created my first site on GitHub. Check it out <a href="https://cartlong7.github.io" target="_blank">here!</a>
